# Brain Games

"Brain Games" - a set of five console games, built on the principle of popular mobile applications for brain pumping. Each game asks questions to which you have to give correct answers. After three correct answers, the game is considered to be completed. Incorrect answers end the game and prompt you to go through it again.

Games:

- Calculator. Arithmetic expressions to be calculated.
- Progression. Finding missing numbers in a sequence of numbers.
- Determining an even number.
- Determining the greatest common divisor.
- Determining a prime number.

```
